COVID ANALYSIS 

I have performed exploratory data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the world. 

The objective of this analysis was to understand the duration of the disease's exponential spread, the death trend, the countries that were impacted, and the ratios of the confirmed cases, active cases, and recovery rates.

To achieve this objective, I worked with multiple datasets such as 'country_wise_latest.csv', 'covid_19_clean_complete.csv', 'day_wise.csv', 'full_grouped.csv', 'usa_country_wise.csv', and 'worldometer_data.csv'.

Based on my analysis, I found that the USA had the most COVID-19 cases, with a total of 5,032,179 cases. While the disease was actively spreading in the country, there were little to no critical cases. 
However, the USA accounted for the most deaths, with a total of 162,804, as well as the most recoveries, with 2,576,668 cases. Additionally, the country had the most active cases, with 2,292,707.

The first cases of COVID-19 were reported on January 23rd, 2020, and by July 2020, the number of confirmed cases had increased to over 16.2518 million worldwide. 
The USA accounted for the most cases, followed by Brazil and India. France held the 20th place with very few active cases.

In terms of deaths, Ecuador had the least number of deaths (i.e. 5877), followed by Pakistan. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia had the least active cases (i.e. 34,082).
